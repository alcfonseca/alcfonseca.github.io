					<h1>Data Privacy</h1>
					<p><span class="bold">Hosting</span></p>
					<p>Our hoster collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits:
					IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request comes and information about browser and operating system.</p>
					<p>This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
					<p>There is no tracking and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymous, statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.</p>
					<p>We use the following hoster to make our website available:</p>
					
					<p>GitHub Inc.</br>
					88 Colin P Kelly Jr St</br>
					San Francisco, CA 94107</br>
					United States</p>

					<p>This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR in not having to maintain a server on our premises. Server location is USA.</p>

					<p>For more information on how to object to and remove GitHub, see: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages</p>

					<p>You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined within the framework of a weighing of interests.</p>

					<p>The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.</p>

					<p>The processing of the data specified under this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without processing.</p>

					<p>GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all worldwide activities in which GitHub processes personal data of natural persons in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1–the-standard-contractual- clauses-processors</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Legal Notice</span></p>
					<p>In principle, an order processing contract must be concluded with the hoster. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has made an exception for the hosting of purely static websites. In the event that the website is used for self-portrayal, e.g. by clubs or small businesses, no personal data flow to the operator and no tracking takes place, there is no order processing. It goes on to say: “The fact that IP addresses, ie personal data, must also be processed when hosting static websites does not lead to the assumption of order processing. That would not be appropriate. Rather, the (short-term) IP address storage is still to be attributed to the TK access switching of the website host according to the TKG and primarily serves the hoster's security purposes. "(https://www.lda.bayern.de/media/veroeffentlichungen/FAQ_Hosting_keine_Auftragsverarbeitung.pdf) We assume that this exception applies to GitHub Pages.</p>
