					<h2>Turning Flatland into an online reading experience ⸺</h2>
					<h3>UI/UX, branding</h3>
					<h3>2018/1</h3>
					<p>For my capstone project in university, I decided to bring one of my favorite books into the digital realm, using resources such as animation and interesting interactions as a way to rekindle interest of the younger folk. The project was developed individually over the course of a year with advice from a mentor at university.</p>

				<h1>Initial Preparations ⸺</h1>
				<p><span class="bold">Selecting the target group.</span> Based on recent studies showing a drop in reading among teenagers and their growing interest in geeky stuff, a younger audience was selected for this project.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Research.</span> Research on the state of the web, best practices for usability on desktop/mobile and interactivity/animation was conducted with the objective of constructing an easy go-to reference for later in development.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Analyzing similar projects.</span> The last step of the preparation was dedicated to analyzing projects based on visual style, structure and Nielsen’s heuristics. This served as examples of what worked well or not and what was already on the market.</p>

				<h1>Figuring It Out ⸺</h1>
				<p><span class="bold">User flow. </span> Based on the research on the target group a user flow was developed, keeping in mind possible entry methods such as social media and focusing on the aim of having the user share the site at the end.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Tools, features and content. </span> By analyzing similar projects I was able to find out what were some features to make the reading experience seamless. This helped narrow down what was really necessary, like a navigation system and reading progress.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Wireframes. </span> After nailing that all down, it was finally pencil on paper. Some crazy sketching later, the best elements were selected and joined into a wireframe for testing.</p>

				<h1>How do I turn this on? ⸺</h1>

				<p><span class="bold">Research findings. </span> Results were as expected, with most participants being able to complete all the tasks. Difficulties with seeing reading progress and identifying the share button were noted and focused on for next iterations.</p>

				<h1>All Together Now ⸺</h1>
				<p><span class="bold">Moodboards. </span> Moodboard explorations revealed directions for possible visual styles as well as inspiration from past book covers.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Graphic design. </span> I investigated type, colors and textures based on these explorations and decided on a modern and geometric solution. This direction tied in perfectly with the book’s content.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">High fidelity prototypes. </span> After coming to a decision on the visual language for the project, I applied it onto a few of the earlier low-fidelity wireframes using Figma, tweaking when necessary.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">User testing. </span> As a final close to the project, I conducted a desirability test with another group of participants to evaluate if the site aligned with initial expectations. This surfaced some usability issues with color which were fixed for the final prototype.</p>

				<h1>Final Reflections ⸺</h1>
				<p>Adapting my usually short design process to include in-depth research and academic writing was a great exercise in prioritizing what is most important depending on the project. It was rewarding to be able to use all the data collected and have positive feedback on the deliverables after a long year.</p>
