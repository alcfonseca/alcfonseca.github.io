					<h2>Creating a First Time User Experience ⸺</h2>
					<h3 class="token">UX/UI</h3>
					<h3 class="token">2022</h3>
					<p><span class="bold">Product. </span>SAP Process Automation is SAP's low-code no-code hyperautomation solution, that joins automated bots with workflow management to create an end-to-end solution for automating processes.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Goals and Challenges. </span> The product, until this point, had a very inconsistent way of presenting help. The objective was to create a consistent help concept, with a focus on an onboarding experience for first time users. This was sorely needed, as the product is very complex and users had a steep learning curve. The challenge was working with SAP's existing solution, SAP Companion, and creating a result that would be flexible enough for all product areas.</p>

				<h1>Initial Preparations ⸺</h1>
				<p><span class="bold">SAP Companion. </span>First, we set off searching for existing solutions inside the company. We then discovered SAP Companion, an embedded application that offers in-context help, and a growing recommendation within the company to adopt it. I spearheaded the topic, meeting with Project Managers and developers from our and SAP Companion's team to integrate the solution.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Current Solutions.</span> As SAP Companion was being integrated, we continued looking into the current help options we offered and analysing their pros and cons.</p>

				<h1>Figuring It Out ⸺</h1>
				<p><span class="bold">Problem Shaping Workshop.</span> As part of an internal quality sprint, we conducted a workshop with key stakeholders to find out what were some current issues. From this data, we carried out problem solution mappings and clustering to build user journeys.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">User Journey.</span> As the focus was the first time user experience, we used the results of our workshop to create user flows, so we could pinpoint overlapping and missing solutions. We knew since the beginning that we wanted to reduce the current amount of different help offerings and, if possible, bundle the remaining ones into the SAP Companion, which would be our central help feature.</p>

				<h1>Building a solution ⸺</h1>
				<p><span class="bold">High-fidelity.</span> After we had created the central flow of the experience, we went onto translating it into screens. Working closely with User Assistance Developers and key stakeholders, we created a flexible template flow for onboarding, so that every product area could adapt easily to it.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">User Testing. </span>Once we had a high-fidelity flow and after internal expert feedback, we created a prototype and started planning for testing. The objective was to get feedback early and improve on our initial concept. I then created an unmoderated study in UserZoom together with our team's user researcher.</p>
				<p>The findings from the study were that all users knew how to use the features (confirmed in the recordings) and that they found value in the guidance functionalities they used (post-task questionnaires). Additionally, I was able to create a few action points to further improve the concept.</p>

				<h1>Results ⸺</h1>
				<p>The result is a planned full integration of SAP Companion by the end of the year, alongside with the first time user onboarding. The components of the user onboarding concept allow for each product area to adapt it to their needs and lets User Assistance Developers independently work on help content. The user testing is currently in progress.</p>
